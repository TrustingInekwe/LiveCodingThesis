Fun to play on a tool that I haven't used before. 
Live-coding with GUI was quite nice
Easy to use
I really enjoyed the abiliity to just use a keyboard rather than the mouse.  It makes it more relaxing to use somehow.  I also felt that the navigation system was super consistent throughout which made for a learning curve that was not too steep at all.  It was also nice to have all the information I needed right there in front of me rather than having many hidden menus and settings.
The visuals are very helpful to help implement the beats and set the measures. The interface is not very overwhelming. I think with more instruments it would be very cool to use for teaching music and rhythm composition. 
I like how you can edit the beat while the current version is still playing, I like that you can change the gain
